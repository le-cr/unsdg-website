    <h2>What Is Hunger?</h2>
    <p>World hunger is an uncomfortable or painful physical sensation caused by insufficient consumption of dietary
        energy. It
        becomes chronic when the person does not consume a sufficient amount of calories (dietary energy) on a regular
        basis to
        lead a normal, active and healthy life on a global scale.
        World hunger is the second UN SDG goal and it aims seeks sustainable solutions to end hunger in all its forms by
        2030
        and to achieve food security. The aim is to ensure that everyone everywhere has enough good-quality food to lead
        a
        healthy life.
        Achieving this Goal will require better access to food and the widespread promotion of sustainable agriculture.
        This
        entails improving the productivity and incomes of small-scale farmers by promoting equal access to land,
        technology and
        markets, sustainable food production systems
        and resilient agricultural practices.
        It also requires increased investments through international cooperation to bolster the productive capacity of
        agriculture in developing countries.
        World hunger has taken many lives and is also part of poverty, so in other words the more that people help
        against
        hunger the more people will fight against poverty as well.

    <h2>What Is the Effect of Hunger on People?</h2>
    <p>There are many effects of world hunger on humans such as starvation, high rates of obesity, heart disease, and
        diabetes.
        These are the main and most dangerous effects of world hunger.
        Starvation is the most harmful effect because people are not getting enough food to survive. For example, almost
        10% of
        the global population goes to sleep hungry. This can result in severe pain and death. Obesity occurs when people
        eat too
        much food without working out. However, how does this happen to people that are not getting enough food? Well,
        obesity
        is one of the main causes of hunger because many people become obese. They spend all a lot of money on food and
        go into
        poverty. They canâ€™t fulfill their food craving which is one of the main causes of poverty and hunger. Heart
        disease is a
        very painful of world hunger. When people go hungry, steroid hormones are released inside their bodies causing
        high
        chances of heart disease. Diabetes occurs with people that don't have enough food because they are forced to eat
        junk
        food lying around.
        All in all, these are the effects of world hunger and how they are affecting people. After reading this, I hope
        that you
        will help support the UN SDGs.
