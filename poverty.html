    <h2>What Is Poverty?</h2>
    <p>The first UN SDG aims for eradicating poverty by 2030 - one of the greatest global challenges in the world.
        Poverty
        means the lack of money. This goal also ensures the coverage of the poor and vulnerable.
        At the Millennium Summit in September 2000, 189 countries agreed to “spare no effort to free our fellow men,
        women and
        children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty….” This commitment was turned into eight
        goals,
        called the MDGs. The MDGs helped over one billion people from poverty, hunger and injustice.
        Though actions have been taken to eradicate poverty, it still persists. As a result, the 2030 Agenda for
        Sustainable
        Development and its set of Sustainable Development Goals have been established, as stated in the Declaration of
        the
        Agenda, “to build upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seek to address their unfinished
        business.”
        A few actions to poverty eradication include more jobs and productive resources, providing social services to
        everyone,
        develop systems that helps those who cannot support themselves, and strengthening international bonds to help
        stop
        poverty.

    <h2>What Is the Effect of Poverty on People?</h2>
    <p>Poverty affects people all around the world. Adults and children can be affected by poverty. Many people in
        poverty
        barely have enough money to purchase necessities such as food, water, shelter, and medicine. Some people in
        poverty
        don’t even have any money. If people can’t afford these necessities, they will face many difficulties. Food and
        water
        are needed to survive because they give you energy. People need shelter because they can’t survive in harsh
        conditions
        and temperatures. However, some people in poverty don’t have that luxury and are forced to live on the streets
        in the
        harsh conditions. Some people in poverty can’t afford medicine. When they are sick, they won’t be able to
        recover
        quickly without any medications. Education is also important to people. However, many people in poverty don’t
        have
        enough money to afford education. This is how poverty can drastically affect humans all over the world.
